# Doberman
Simple algo backtester

# Usage
The Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks` directory have examples showing how to use the 
backtester on a single stock ticker. You can use the scripts in the `sample_scripts`
directory to test multiple stocks in parallel.

# Data Sources
I used [Stooq](https://stooq.com/db/h/) as the data source to populate the HDF5 data files.
